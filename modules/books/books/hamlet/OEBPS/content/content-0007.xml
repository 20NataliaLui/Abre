Of all Danish men, there is only one who can be called famous on the largest scale; only one with whom the thoughts of men are for ever busied in Europe, America, Australia, ay, even in Asia and Africa, wherever European culture has made its way; and this one never existed, at any rate in the form in which he has become known to the world. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet </span>literature is comparable in extent to the literature of one of the smaller European peoples&#8212;the Slovaks, for instance; and as it is interesting to follow with the eye the process by which a block of marble slowly assumes human form, so it is interesting to observe how the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet </span>theme gradually acquires its Shakespearian character.</p>

Fengo murders his brave brother Horvendil, and marries his widow Gerutha (Gertrude). Horvendil&#39;s son, Amleth, determines to disarm Fengo&#39;s malevolence by feigning madness. In order to test whether he is really mad, a beautiful girl is thrown in his way, who is to note whether, in his passion for her, he still maintains the appearance of madness. But a foster-brother and friend of Amleth&#39;s reveals the plot to him; the girl, too, has an old affection for him; and nothing is discovered. Here lie the germs of Ophelia and Horatio.</p>

having a conscientious objection to lying, he so contorted his sayings that, though he always said what he meant, people could not discover whether he meant what he said, or himself understood it&#8212;an account of the matter which applies quite as well to the dark sayings of the Shakespearian Hamlet as to the naive riddling of the Jutish Amleth.</span></p>

Therefore they nail his sword fast into its sheath. When Amleth has set fire to the hall and rushes into Fengo&#39;s chamber to murder him, he takes the King&#39;s sword from its hook and replaces it with his own, which the King in vain attempts to draw before he dies.</p>

The figure of Hamlet, as it at last shaped itself in Shakespeare&#39;s imagination and came to life in his drama, is one of the very few immortal figures of art and poetry, which, like Cervantes&#39; Don Quixote, exactly its contemporary, and Goethe&#39;s Faust of two centuries later, present to generation after generation problems to brood over and enigmas to solve.</p>

and ended their university course much earlier than in our days. It accords with this age that his mother should address him as &#39;boy&#39; (&#39;How now, boy !&#39; iii. 4&#8212;a phrase which is deleted in the next edition), and that the word &#39;young&#39; should be continually prefixed to his name, not merely to distinguish him from his father. The King, too, in the early edition (not in that of 1604) currently addresses him as &#39;son Hamlet&#39;; and finally his mother is still young enough to arouse&#8212;or at least to enable Claudius plausibly to pretend&#8212;the passion which has such terrible results.

The decisive proof, however, of the fact that Hamlet at first appeared in Shakespeare&#39;s eyes much younger (eleven years, to be precise) than he afterwards made him, is to be found in the graveyard scene (v. 1). In the older edition, the First Gravedigger says that the skull of the jester Yorick has lain a dozen years in the earth; in the edition of 1604 this is changed to twenty-three years. Here, too, it is explicitly indicated that Hamlet, who as a child knew Yorick, is now thirty years old; for the Gravedigger first states that he took to his trade on the very day on which Prince Hamlet was born, and a little later adds: &#39;I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.&#39; It accords with this that the Player-King now mentions thirty years as the time that has elapsed since his marriage with the Queen, and that Ophelia (iii. 1) speaks of Hamlet as the &#39; unmatched form of blown [<i>i.e.</i> mature] youth.&#39;</p>

He had been living far from the great world, in quiet Wittenberg, never doubting that life was in fact as harmonious as it is apt to appear in the eyes of a young prince. He believed in the realisation of ideals here on earth, imagined that intellectual nobility and fine feelings ruled the world, that justice reigned in public, faith and honour in private, life. He admired his great father, honoured his beautiful mother, passionately loved the charming Ophelia, thought nobly of humankind, and especially of women. From the moment he loses his father, and is forced to change his opinion of his mother, this serene view of life is darkened. If his mother has been able to forget his father and marry this man, what is woman worth? and what is life worth? At the very outset, then, when he has not even heard of his father&#39;s ghost, much less seen or held converse with it, sheer despair speaks in his monologue:&#8212;</span></p>

Confide in her he cannot; she has shown how unequal she is to the exigencies of the situation by refusing to receive his letters and visits.

But the sole cause of this impotence is the paralysing grasp laid on all his faculties by his new realisation of what life is, and the broodings born of this realisation.

He has so much presence of mind that he is never at a loss for the aptest retort, and, along with it, such absence of mind that he lets go his fixed determination in order to follow up some train of thought or thread some dream-labyrinth. He appals, amuses, captivates, perplexes, disquiets us. Few characters in fiction have so disquieted the world. Although he is incessantly talking, he is solitary by nature.

one blow she has lost both father and lover. In her madness she does not speak Hamlet&#39;s name, nor show any trace of sorrow that it is he who has murdered her father. Forgetfulness of this cruellest blow mitigates her calamity; her hard fate condemns her to solitude; and this solitude is peopled and alleviated by madness.</span></p>

In both cases we have the tragic love-tie between genius and tender girlhood. Faust kills Gretchen&#39;s mother as Hamlet kills Ophelia&#39;s father. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Faust </span>also there is a duel between the hero and his mistress&#39;s brother, in which the brother is killed. And in both cases the young girl in her misery goes mad. It is clear that Goethe actually had Ophelia in his thoughts, for he makes his Mephistopheles sing a song to Gretchen which is a direct imitation, almost a translation, of Ophelia&#39;s song about Saint Valentine&#39;s Day. There is, however, a more delicate poetry in Ophelia&#39;s madness than in Gretchen&#39;s. Gretchen&#39;s intensifies the tragic impression of the young girl&#39;s ruin; Ophelia&#39;s alleviates both her own and the spectator&#39;s suffering.</p>

and mastering at last both itself and the world. He changes gradually under his creator&#39;s hands into a great symbol; but in the second half of his life a superabundance of allegoric traits veils his individual humanity. It did not lie in Shakespeare&#39;s way to embody a being whose efforts, like Faust&#39;s, were directed towards experience, knowledge, perception of truth in general. Even when Shakespeare rises highest, he keeps nearer the earth.</span></p>

We love thee like a brother. Thy melancholy is ours, thy wrath is ours, thy contemptuous wit avenges us on those who fill the earth with their empty noise and are its masters. We know the depth of thy suffering when wrong and hypocrisy triumph, and oh ! thy still deeper suffering on feeling that that nerve in thee is severed which should lead from thought to victorious action. To us, too, the voices of the mighty dead have spoken from the under-world. We, too, have seen our mother wrap the purple robe of power round the murderer of &#39;the majesty of buried Denmark.&#39; We, too, have been betrayed by the friends of our youth; for us, too, have swords been dipped in poison. How well do we know that graveyard mood in which disgust and sorrow for all earthly things seize upon the soul! The breath from open graves has set us, too, dreaming with a skull in our hands!</p>
