                  <p id="p302">Those dreams that in the starlit silence fall:</p>

                  <p id="p305">I passed a squalid farm; from byre and midden</p>

                  <p id="p306">Came the rank smell that brought me once again</p>

                  <p id="p307">A dream of war that in the past was hidden.</p>

                  <p id="p314">Rifles, equipment, packs.</p>

                  <p id="p315">On filthy straw they sit in the gloom, each face</p>

                  <p id="p327">And burning bitterness</p>
