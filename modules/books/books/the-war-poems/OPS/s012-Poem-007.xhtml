                  <p id="p156">Three hours ago he blundered up the trench,</p>

                  <p id="p157">Sliding and poising, groping with his boots;</p>

                  <p id="p158">Sometimes he tripped and lurched against the walls</p>

                  <p id="p159">With hands that pawed the sodden bags of chalk.</p>

                  <p id="p160">He couldn&#8217;t see the man who walked in front;</p>

                  <p id="p161">Only he heard the drum and rattle of feet</p>

                  <p id="p162">Stepping along the trench-boards,&#8212;often splashing</p>

                  <p id="p163">Wretchedly where the sludge was ankle-deep.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza20">


                  <p id="p164">Voices would grunt, &#8220;Keep to your right,&#8212;make way!&#8221;</p>

                  <p id="p165">When squeezing past the men from the front-line:</p>

                  <p id="p166">White faces peered, puffing a point of red;</p>

                  <p id="p167">Candles and braziers glinted through the chinks</p>

                  <p id="p168">And curtain-flaps of dug-outs; then the gloom</p>

                  <p id="p169">Swallowed his sense of sight; he stooped and swore</p>

                  <p id="p170">Because a sagging wire had caught his neck.</p>

                  <p id="p171">A flare went up; the shining whiteness spread</p>

                  <p id="p172">And flickered upward, showing nimble rats,</p>

                  <p id="p173">And mounds of glimmering sand-bags, bleached with rain;</p>

                  <p id="id00113">Then the slow, silver moment died in dark.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza21">


                  <p id="p174">The wind came posting by with chilly gusts</p>

                  <p id="p175">And buffeting at corners, piping thin</p>

                  <p id="p176">And dreary through the crannies; rifle-shots</p>

                  <p id="p177">Would split and crack and sing along the night,</p>

                  <p id="p178">And shells came calmly through the drizzling air</p>

                  <p id="id00114">To burst with hollow bang below the hill.<span class="pagebreak-rw" id="pagebreak-rw_12" epub:type="pagebreak">12</span>

                  <p id="p1099">Three hours ago he stumbled up the trench;</p>

                  <p id="p180">Now he will never walk that road again:</p>

                  <p id="p181">He must be carried back, a jolting lump</p>

                  <p id="p182">Beyond all need of tenderness and care;</p>

                  <p id="id00115">A nine-stone corpse with nothing more to do.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza23">


                  <p id="p183">He was a young man with a meagre wife</p>

                  <p id="p184">And two pale children in a Midland town;</p>

                  <p id="p185">He showed the photograph to all his mates;</p>

                  <p id="p186">And they considered him a decent chap</p>

                  <p id="p187">Who did his work and hadn&#8217;t much to say,</p>

                  <p id="p188">And always laughed at other people&#8217;s jokes</p>

                  <p id="id00116">Because he hadn&#8217;t any of his own.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza24">


                  <p id="p189">That night, when he was busy at his job</p>

                  <p id="p190">Of piling bags along the parapet,</p>

                  <p id="p191">He thought how slow time went, stamping his feet,</p>

                  <p id="id00117">And blowing on his fingers, pinched with cold.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza25">


                  <p id="p192">He thought of getting back by half-past twelve,</p>

                  <p id="p193">And tot of rum to send him warm to sleep</p>

                  <p id="p194">In draughty dug-out frowsty with the fumes</p>

                  <p id="id00118">Of coke, and full of snoring, weary men.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza26">


                  <p id="p195">He pushed another bag along the top,</p>

                  <p id="p196">Craning his body outward; then a flare</p>

                  <p id="p197">Gave one white glimpse of No Man&#8217;s Land and wire;</p>

                  <p id="p198">And as he dropped his head the instant split</p>

                  <p id="id00119">His startled life with lead, and all went out.</p>
