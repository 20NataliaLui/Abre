                  <p id="p1075">He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped</p>

                  <p id="p1076">Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;</p>

                  <p id="p1077">Aqueous like floating rays of amber light,</p>

                  <p id="p1078">Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep,&#8212;</p>

                  <p id="p1079">Silence and safety; and his mortal shore</p>

                  <p id="p1080">Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.</p>

                  <p id="p1081">Some one was holding water to his mouth.</p>

                  <p id="p1082">He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped</p>

                  <p id="p1083">Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot</p>

                  <p id="p1084">The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.</p>

                  <p id="p1085">Water&#8212;calm, sliding green above the weir;</p>

                  <p id="p1086">Water&#8212;a sky-lit alley for his boat,</p>

                  <p id="p1087">Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers</p>

                  <p id="p1088">And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,</p>

                  <p id="p1089">He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.</p>

                  <p id="p1090">Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,</p>

                  <p id="p1091">Blowing the curtain to a glimmering curve.</p>

                  <p id="p1092">Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars</p>

                  <p id="p1093">Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;</p>

                  <p id="p1094">Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,</p>

                  <p id="p1095">Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.</p>

               </div>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza151">


                  <p id="p1096">Rain; he could hear it rustling through the dark;</p>

                  <p id="p1097">Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;</p>

                  <p id="p1098">Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers</p>

                  <p id="p1181">Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace</p>

                  <p id="p1101">Gently and slowly washing life away.</p>

                  <p id="p1103">He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain</p>

                  <p id="p1104">Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore</p>

                  <p id="p1105">His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.</p>

                  <p id="p1106">But some one was beside him; soon he lay</p>

                  <p id="p1107">Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.</p>

                  <p id="p1108">And Death, who&#8217;d stepped toward him, paused and stared.</p>

               <div class="poem-rw stanza-rw" id="stanza152">


                  <p id="p1109">Light many lamps and gather round his bed.</p>

                  <p id="p1110">Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live.</p>

                  <p id="p1111">Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.</p>

                  <p id="p1112">He&#8217;s young; he hated war; how should he die</p>

                  <p id="p1113">When cruel old campaigners win safe through?</p>

                  <p id="p1114">But Death replied: &#8220;I choose him.&#8221; So he went,</p>

                  <p id="p1115">And there was silence in the summer night;</p>

                  <p id="p1116">Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.</p>

                  <p id="p1117">Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.</p>
