The fact is, the Time Traveler was one of those men who are too clever to be believed; you never felt that you saw all round him ; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveler&#39;s words, we should have shown <span style="font-style:italic;">him </span>far less skepticism. The point is, we should have seen his motives&#8212;a porkbutcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveler had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the fame of a clever man seemed tricks<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA26.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.37.1.0.box.431.286.655.1260.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA26"></a><a id="GBS.PA26.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA26.w.1.0.0"></a>
in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don&#39;t think any of us said very much about time traveling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linn&#230;an. He said he had seen a similar thing at T&#252;bingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.</span></p>

who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor afore-mentioned, a certain journalist, and another&#8212;a quiet, shy man with a beard&#8212;whom I didn&#39;t know, and who, as far as my observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveler&#39;s absence, and I suggested time traveling, in a half jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the &quot; ingenious paradox and trick&quot; we had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it first.</span></p>

His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it&#8212;a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.

His eyes grew brighter, and a faint color came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. &quot;I&#39;m going to wash and dress, and then I&#39;ll come down and explain things. Save me some of that mutton.

Again I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on them but a pair of tattered, bloodstained socks. Then the door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool gathering. Then, &quot; Remarkable Behavior of an Eminent Scientist,&quot; I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright dinner table.</p>

The Time Traveler pushed his glass toward the Silent Man and rang it with his finger nail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA35.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.46.1.0.box.229.290.651.815.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA35"></a><a id="GBS.PA35.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA35.w.1.0.0"></a>
own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveler devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveler through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveler pushed his plate away, and looked round us.</span></p>

It&#39;s too long a story to tell over greasy plates.&quot; And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.</p>

I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It&#39;s true&#8212;every word of it, all the same.

And with that the Time Traveler began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterward he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink&#8212;and, above all, my own inadequacy&#8212;to express its quality. You read, I will suppose, attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker&#39;s white, sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the smoking room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveler&#39;s face.</span></p>
