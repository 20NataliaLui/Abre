I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA186.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.197.1.0.box.452.289.649.421.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA186"></a><a id="GBS.PA186.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA186.w.1.0.0"></a>
the cupolas above the ways to the underworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the overworld people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the cattle they knew of no enemies, and provided against no needs. And their end was the same.</span></p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA186.w.1.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.197.1.1.box.449.726.651.773.q.60">&quot;I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly toward comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanence as its watchwords, it had attained its hopes&#8212;to come to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA186.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.197.1.2.box.491.1508.607.39.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA186.w.1.2.0"></a>&quot;It is a law of nature we overlook,<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA187.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.198.1.0.box.219.305.652.575.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA187"></a><a id="GBS.PA187.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA187.w.1.0.0"></a>
that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.</span></p>

But that perfect state had lacked one thing even of mechanical perfection&#8212;absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on the feeding of the underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The underworld, being in contact with machinery which,<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA188.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.199.1.0.box.444.299.650.624.q.60">
however perfect, still needs some little thought outside of habit, had probably retained, perforce, rather more initiative, if less of every other human character, than the upper. And when other meat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it in my last view of the world of 810,701. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I give it to you.</span></p>

I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that I took my own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf, I had a long and refreshing sleep.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA188.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.199.1.2.box.442.1419.649.139.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA188.w.1.2.0"></a>&quot;I awoke a little before sunsetting.

stretching myself I came on down the hill toward the white sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other played with the matches in my pocket.</span></p>

<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA189.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.200.1.2.box.226.793.648.89.q.70">&quot;At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA189.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.200.1.3.box.226.891.649.422.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA189.w.1.3.0"></a>&quot;Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the white sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry not to use it.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA189.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.200.1.4.box.226.1329.648.237.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA189.w.1.4.0"></a>&quot;A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped toward the portal. For once at least I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks. Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh,<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA190.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.201.1.0.box.432.301.649.379.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA190"></a><a id="GBS.PA190.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA190.w.1.0.0"></a>
I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose.</span></p>

The bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the dark&#8212;trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA190.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.201.1.2.box.431.1127.649.422.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA190.w.1.2.0"></a>&quot;I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came toward me. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box.</p>

The little brutes were close upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the lever, and began to scramble into the saddle of the Machine. Then came one hand upon me and then another.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA191.w.1.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.202.1.1.box.249.671.650.526.q.60">&quot;Then I had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand I had to butt in the dark with my head&#8212;I could hear the Morlock&#39;s skull ring&#8212;to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last scramble.</p>
<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA191.w.1.2.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent:1em;" id="para.202.1.2.box.249.1206.650.325.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA191.w.1.2.0"></a>&quot;But at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found myself in the same gray light and tumult I have already described.</p>
