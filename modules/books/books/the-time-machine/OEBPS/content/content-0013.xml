I felt a peculiar shrinking from their pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached color of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zo&#246;logical museum. And they were cold to the touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate.</p>

I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight&#8212;that night it was that Weena was among them&#8212;and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even then that when in the course of a few days the moon passed through its last quarter and the nights became dark, the appearance of these unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, these new vermin that had replaced the old, might be more abundant.</span></p>

Going to the southwestward toward the rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth century Banstead, a vast green pile, of a different character from any I had hitherto seen. It was larger than even the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the facade appeared to me Oriental in its character. The face of it had the luster as well as the pale green tint, a kind of bluish green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. The difference in appearance in the building suggested a difference in its use. I was minded to push on and explore it. But the day was growing late and I had come<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA123.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.134.1.0.box.253.286.650.230.q.70"><a id="GBS.PA123"></a><a id="GBS.PA123.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA123.w.1.0.0"></a>

I perceived my curiosity regarding this great pile of Green Porcelain was a mere self-deception to shirk the experience I dreaded by another day. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early morning toward a well near the ruins of granite and aluminum.</p>

Glancing upward I saw the aperture, a mere small blue disk above me, in which a star was visible, and little Weena&#39;s head appeared as a round black projection. The thudding sound of some machine below me grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that minute circle above was profoundly dark. When I looked up again Weena had disappeared.</p>

I was roused by a soft hand touching my face. Starting up in the darkness, I snatched at my matches and hastily striking one saw three grotesque, white creatures, similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the light. Living as they did<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA127.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.138.1.0.box.247.279.651.714.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA127"></a><a id="GBS.PA127.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA127.w.1.0.0"></a>
in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the eyes of the abyssmal fishes or of any purely nocturnal creatures, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing up dark gutters and tunnels from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.</span></p>

Some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal upon which a meal seemed to be spread. The Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous.

It had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I had wasted almost half of the box in astonishing the above ground people, to whom fire was a novelty. As I say, I had four left.</p>

I was sensible of a dull, unpleasant odor. I fancy I detected the breathing of a number of those little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing.</p>

The sudden realization<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA131.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.142.1.0.box.227.294.654.675.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA131"></a><a id="GBS.PA131.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA131.w.1.0.0"></a>
of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and possible actions came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away from me, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently and shouted again, rather discordantly. This time they were not so seriously alarmed and made a queer laughing noise as they came toward me again.</span></p>

I determined to strike another match and escape under its glare. Eking it out with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But hardly had I entered this when my light was blown out, and I could hear them in the blackness rustling like wind among leaves and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.</p>

several hands again, and there was no mistake now that they were trying to draw me back. I struck another light and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarcely imagine how nauseatingly inhuman those pale, chinless faces and great lidless, pinkish-gray eyes seemed, as they stared stupidly, evidently blinded by the light.</span></p>

That had almost burned through as I reached the opening of the tunnel upon the well. I lay down on the edge, for the throbbing whirl of the air-pumping machine below made me giddy, and felt sideways for the projecting hooks. As I did so my feet were grasped from behind and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match&#8212;and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and kicking violently disengaged myself from the<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA133.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.144.1.0.box.218.285.650.137.q.60">
