It lay very high upon a turfy down, and, looking northeastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary, or an arm of the sea, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been.

She always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.</p>

Clearly, the place had been derelict for a very considerable time.</p>

As I approached this I recognized by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the <span style="font-style:italic;">me</span><span style="font-style:italic;">gatherium. </span>The skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place where rain water had dripped through some leak in the roof, the skeleton had decayed away. Further along the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a <span style="font-style:italic;">bronto</span><span style="font-style:italic;">saurus. </span>My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going toward the side of the gallery I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time.

though the inevitable process of decay that had been warded off for a time, and had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninetynine-hundreths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness, if with extreme slowness, at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds.

Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine and the Morlocks receded a little from my mind. The curiosity concerning human destiny that had led to my time traveling was removed. Now, judging from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain had a great deal more in it than a gallery of palaeontology; possibly historical galleries, it might be even a library. To me, at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of old-time geology in decay.</span></p>

Here I was more in my element, for I found rising on either side of me the huge bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded, and many broken down, but some still fairly complete in all their parts. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these, the more so since for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest guesses of what they were for. I fancied if I could solve these puzzles I should find myself in the possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.</span></p>

As one went down the length of the place, the ground came up against these windows, until there was at last a pit like the &#39;area&#39; of a London house, before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until Weena&#39;s increasing apprehension attracted my attention.</span></p>

the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived. I felt that I was wasting my time in my academic examination of this machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire.

For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft coating of dust, to Weena&#39;s huge delight, I solemnly performed a sort of composite dance, whistling &#39;The Land of the Leal&#39; as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest cancan, in part a step dance, in part a skirt dance,&#8212;so far as my tail coat permitted,&#8212;and in part original. For naturally I am inventive, as you know.</p>

Yet oddly enough I found here a far more unlikely substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that, by chance, I sup<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA163.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.174.1.0.box.236.285.651.918.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA163"></a><a id="GBS.PA163.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA163.w.1.0.0"></a>posed had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first the stuff was paraffin wax, and smashed the jar accordingly. But the odor of camphor was unmistakable. It struck me as singularly odd, that among the universal decay, this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousand years. Ir reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions of years ago. I was about to throw this camphor on one side, and then remembering that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame, I put it into my pocket.</span></p>

It would require a great effort of memory to recall it at all in the proper order. I remember a long gallery containing the rusting stands of arms of all ages, and that I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron, after all, promised best against the bronze gates. There were rusty guns, pistols, and rifles here; most of them were masses of rust, but many of aluminum, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered ; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens there. In another place was a vast array of idols&#8212;Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA165.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.176.1.0.box.225.296.652.88.q.70"><a id="GBS.PA165"></a><a id="GBS.PA165.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA165.w.1.0.0"></a>

I went through gallery after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself near a model of a tin mine, and then by the merest accident I discovered in an air-tight case two dynamite cartridges; I shouted &#39;Eureka!&#39; and smashed the case joyfully. Then came a doubt. I hesitated, and then selecting a little side gallery I made my essay. I never felt such a bitter disappointment as I did then, waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for the explosion that never came. Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence there. I really believe had they not been so, I should have rushed off incontinently there and then, and blown sphinx, bronze doors, and, as it proved, my chances of finding the<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA166.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.177.1.0.box.421.291.648.81.q.70">

Night was now creeping upon us and my inaccessible hiding-place was still to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my possession a thing that was perhaps the best of all defenses against the Morlocks. I had matches again. I also had the camphor in my pocket if a blaze were required. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open again, protected by a fire.</p>
