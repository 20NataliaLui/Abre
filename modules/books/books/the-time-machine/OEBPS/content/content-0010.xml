The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied.

At first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different from the world I had known&#8212;even the flowers. The big building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had shifted, perhaps a mile from its present position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, possibly a mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year 802,701, A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded.</p>

ruinous splendor in which I found the world&#8212;for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminum, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumbled heaps, amid which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants&#8212;nettles possibly, but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, built to what end I could not determine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience&#8212;the first intimation of a still stranger discovery&#8212;but of that I will speak in its proper place.</span></p>

Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA66.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.77.1.0.box.409.289.649.284.q.70">

I looked at the half dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sex from each other, these people of the future were alike. And the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged then that children of that time were extremely<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA67.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.78.1.0.box.253.301.649.137.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA67"></a><a id="GBS.PA67.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA67.w.1.0.0"></a>

Where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure, there is less necessity&#8212;indeed there is no necessity&#8212;of an efficient family, and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their children&#39;s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must remind you, was my speculation at the time.<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA68.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.79.1.0.box.412.293.649.88.q.60">

I thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings toward the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time.

I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a view<a id="ORIG-GBS.PA69.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.80.1.0.box.249.301.652.918.q.60"><a id="GBS.PA69"></a><a id="GBS.PA69.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA69.w.1.0.0"></a>
as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have ready spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.</span></p>

The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of life&#8212;the true civilizing process that makes life more and more secure&#8212;had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!</p>

Our agriculture and horticulture destroy just here and there a weed and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favorite plants and animals&#8212;and how few they are&#8212;gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster toward the subjugation of Nature.

desires, once necessary to survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the love of battle, for instance, are no great help&#8212;may even be hindrances&#8212;to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balance and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are, indeed, no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it</span><a id="GBS.PA75.w.1.0.0.1"></a><a id="GBS.PA76"></a><a id="GBS.PA76.w.0.0.0"></a><a id="GBS.PA76.w.1.0.0"></a><a id="ORIG-GBS.PA76.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.87.1.0.box.417.290.650.285.q.60">

To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight; so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity.
