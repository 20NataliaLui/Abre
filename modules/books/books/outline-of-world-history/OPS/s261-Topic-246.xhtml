      <p class="fp-rw" id="rw-p_49380-00001">Aboriginal peoples lived on most of the islands of the Pacific at this time, with Melanesia long populated from the Indonesian chain and Micronesia perhaps having received people from the Philippines. The eastern Pacific islands were occupied by either Mexican and South Americans or possibly by Libyan mariners, or both. The migration of true Polynesians to Hawaii will be discussed in the <b>4th century C.E.</b></p>
