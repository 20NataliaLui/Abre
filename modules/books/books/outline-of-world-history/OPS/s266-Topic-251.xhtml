      <p class="fp-rw" id="rw-p_49385-00001">Once again the reader is referred to previous modules, particularly the 1st and 4th centuries of the Christian Era. It is assumed that in the first Christian millennium there was a gradual increase in the Polynesian tribes and a continued island to island migration via double canoes, so that the more southern islands of the Marquesas, Samoa, Tahiti, etc., were reached by Hawaiian travelers sometime in this period. The large canoes are still used by Indians, Aleuts and others along the Canadian coastal waters, although currently they may add as many as three masts and sails to a thirty-five foot kayak.
