      <p class="fp-rw" id="rw-p_49394-00001">Regarding Australia please see previous modules. It is estimated that the true Polynesians arrived on Easter Island in the late 1400s and lived peacefully there with their predecessors for about 200 years. The remnants of true Polynesian culture are few today, however, indicating that the previous South American cultures were dominant, even after the final battles, which will be described in the <b>17th century chapter</b>. With the exception of some part of the later Easter Island vocabulary and some of the primitive wood-cutting tools, there are no current Polynesian cultural traits on that island. (Ref. <span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note_49394-00001"><a href="#rw-num-note_49394-00001">1</a></span>) Hawaii, the Marquesas, Society Islands, New Zealand and the other eastern Pacific islands all had active Polynesian colonies by this century.
