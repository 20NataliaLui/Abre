      <p class="fp-rw" id="rw-p_49376-00001">Australia continued to be isolated and unknown to the rest of the world. May (Ref. <span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note_49376-00001"><a href="#rw-num-note_49376-00001">1</a></span>) states that Tonga was probably settled by 400 B.C. and it claims to have the world's oldest monarchy, although no further documentation is offered. Although accurate dating information is lacking, we might mention at this time that three islands of the Caroline group of Micronesia - Yap, Lele and Ponape (formerly Ascension Island) - all have prehistoric stone work. Ponape is one of the two volcanic islands in this group and has the ruins of an ancient stone city and dike works. Because of the 250 inches of yearly rainfall archaeological investigation on the island has been difficult. The original people of Micronesia may well have come from the Philippines.
