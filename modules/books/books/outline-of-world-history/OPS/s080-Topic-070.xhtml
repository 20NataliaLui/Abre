      <p class="fp-rw" id="rw-p_49199-00001">An early phase of the Yang-Shao Culture which has been mentioned in connection with China has also been unearthed at Pan-p'o-ts'un in central Asia. It had a slash and burn agriculture, domesticated animals and hand-made pottery. In contrast to our remarks about the invention of the wheel in Sumer, some authorities believe that it was invented in western Asia prior to 3,500 B.C., but the circumstances are unknown. It is possible that the inventors were relatives of the Kurgans of south Russia who did bring wheeled chariots into Europe. (Ref. 175) </p>
