      <p class="fp-rw" id="rw-p_49393-00001">Some authorities feel that it was only in this century that people from east Polynesia came to New Zealand in their double-hulled canoes, to become the Maoris. There is no question, however, that other people had preceded them as old human bones along with the now extinct Moa bird skeletons were found at that time. The exact times and relationships of the Maoris with previous peoples may be clarified in the future. (Please see previous modules.)Â </p>
